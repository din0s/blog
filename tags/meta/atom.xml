        <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.din0s.me/hello-world/">&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for this year was to start expressing myself more. I was inspired by Tiago Forte’s book “&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildingasecondbrain.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Building a Second Brain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” and his concept of “thinking in public”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would like to write at least one post per month, with the frequency ramping up as I get more comfortable with the process (maybe eventually even weekly).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics I am usually interested in are information retrieval, language models, and artificial intelligence in general (I mean, how can you not be? Maybe that’s a topic for another post by itself). So you can expect to see a lot of that, but you might also encounter some other topics I find interesting at the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the plan, let’s see how it goes!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
