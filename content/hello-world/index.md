One of my goals for this year was to start expressing myself more. I was inspired by Tiago Forte's book "[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)" and his concept of "thinking in public".

Ideally, I would like to write at least one post per month, with the frequency ramping up as I get more comfortable with the process (maybe eventually even weekly).

The topics I am usually interested in are information retrieval, language models, and artificial intelligence in general (I mean, how can you not be? Maybe that's a topic for another post by itself). So you can expect to see a lot of that, but you might also encounter some other topics I find interesting at the time.

So that's the plan, let's see how it goes!
